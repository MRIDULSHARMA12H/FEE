        <p>Book Review:- üíå
            One of a kind book that leaves you to point wherein you will try to dig in more. Each and every chapter will keep excited throughout the end. After reading every chapter you will be like "Oh! wait, what?". I personally went into deep thinking after reading each nd every chapter till the end. Amazingly narrated. All the yugas, immortals, Vishnu‚Äôs Dashavtar and lot more are very well incorporated. The story is really engaging and it would not give you a chance to keep the book down, it's really interesting, you would not regret reading the book coz it's worth the hype for sure. The character Om Shastri is really mysterious, the story revolves around him and the hidden history of Hindu mythology. The character kept me curious and confused till the end, I mean "who's he?" (Really mysterious and strange). The facts and knowledge of our Hindu mythology has taken directly from the scriptures. Those who believes in modern science instead of Hindu mythology & thinks that it doesn't exists than you should definitely read this book. Overall just loved the book and now I'm really eager to read the second part of the trilogy.<br> Thank you, Happy Reading</p>
